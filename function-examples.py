''' FUNCTIONS
Some important reminders about Functions in Python:

* Functions are used to simplify the structure of a program
* Usually they perform ONE particular action
* Give them sensible names (use camelText)
* They may or may not have input parameters
* They may or may not return a value
* They can return multiple values
* Everything in the function is indented
